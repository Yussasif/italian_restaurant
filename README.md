## 📖 Project Overview

**Luce di Grano** implies warmth, sunlight, and the earthiness of wheat. The website aims to reflect these values through a rustic yet elegant design system.

**Key Goals:**
* Showcase the menu (focus on fresh pasta and bakery items).
* Facilitate table reservations.
* Tell the brand story ("From the grain to the light").
* Provide location and contact details clearly.
